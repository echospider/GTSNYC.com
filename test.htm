<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Globex Trading Solutions is a leading provider of fully automated, robust, quantitative trading systems for Institutional and retail customers. We are pioneers in applying algorithmic trading solutions for our customers. <br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>The methodology and philosophy of our trading programs are based on risk management and control. Our systems are 100% mechanical; therefore no trades are made on a discretionary basis.</div>
<div>Through extensive research and development, we have determined that several factors move markets and create trends. We developed programs that enter possible developing trends. <br />
<br />
As we view it, there are four types of trades:</div>
<ul type="disc">
    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal;">Large Profits</li>
    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal;">Small Profits</li>
    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal;">Small Losses</li>
    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal;">Large Losses</li>
</ul>
<div>At Globex Trading Solutions we don&rsquo;t predict when and where a particular Index Future will&nbsp;move and begin to trend; therefore we must enter every trade generated from our computer programs based on a technical entry point.</div>
<div>Our systems signal predetermined exits which will allow us to exit our trades with Large Profits, Small Profits or Small Loss.</div>
<div>If we cut out Large Losses, then in effect the Small Losses and Small Profits can offset each other leaving us with what we are searching for: Large profitable trades.</div>
<div>These Large Profitable trades don&rsquo;t come around everyday; therefore we have more than approximately 40% losing trades.</div>
<div>But, in the long run, these Large Profitable trades are designed to generate enough profits to cover numerous Small Losing trades, therefore allowing manageable&nbsp;Small Losing trades and still be able to wait for the Large Profitable trades.<br /></div>
<div>What makes Globex Trading Solutions unique from the competition?<br />
<br />
Globex Trading Solutions only associates with the very best talent, and <br />
has assembled the most comprehensive team available. Starting with developers, who invest their own money in the systems and continuing with technical directors who fully understand the dynamics of the trading markets, the team takes the time to introduce fully automated trading systems that will be suited to compliment each educated investor&rsquo;s <br />
trading portfolio.</div>
