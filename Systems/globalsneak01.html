                      <br>
                      The client agrees that by signing below they are agreeing 
                      to purchase access to the Platinum Global Sneak Systems 
                      and to pay Globex Trading Solutions compensation as specified 
                      below. Upon purchase of the system, effective as the date 
                      of this agreement, Globex Trading Solutions agrees to supply 
                      the client with access from Platinum Global Sneak Systems 
                      to the clients trading account. Purchase of the Platinum 
                      Global Sneak Systems does not require the client to trade, 
                      nor does it require the client to ever open or use a trading 
                      account. Globex Trading Solutions understands it is the 
                      right of the client to use or not use the Platinum Global 
                      Sneak Systems once purchased.<br>
                      <br>
                      The client agrees that the charge for the Platinum Global 
                      Sneak shall be $5,995.00. By signing below I agree to pay 
                      the above total amount of $5,995.00 according to the card 
                      issuer agreement. <br>

                    <p><strong>GUARANTEE</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      This Guarantee will be based on results from the Platinum 
                      Global Sneak Systems only. The performance period lasts 
                      as long as 180 Calendar days.<br>
                      <br>
                      The guarantee states that only at the end of the 180 calendar 
                      day performance period, and only if the total of trades, 
                      do not show a gross profit, is the client then entitled 
                      to a $5,995.00 refund.<br>
                      <br>
                      This gross profit is to be calculated by the total profit 
                      and /or loss of the trades posted by the system and does 
                      not include any slippage, commissions or missed trades by 
                      the client for any reason. The guarantee is not based on 
                      the clients trading account, whether one is opened and funded 
                      or not. Severe drawdownâ€™s to clients accounts can and do 
                      occur, if a clients account is under funded when or after 
                      a drawdown in the system occurs and the client is no longer 
                      able to trade, this will have absolutely no bearing on the 
                      guarantee.<br>
                      <br>
                      Requests for refunds must be in writing and delivered to 
                      our office via US mail within 3 business days upon expiration 
                      of the performance period. Otherwise we will assume it is 
                      your intention to continue receiving the posted trades and 
                      your rights to a refund of the purchase price of the Platinum 
                      Global Sneak trading system as described in the guarantee 
                      section of this agreement will be forever relinquished.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>MONTHLY CHARGE</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      Globex Trading Solutions will charge a monthly maintenance 
                      fee of $149.00 (One Hundred Forty Nine Dollars) per month 
                      only after the successful completion of the performance 
                      period and shall begin during the sixth (6th) Calendar month 
                      . This monthly fee is charged for continued access to the 
                      system, for this the client shall receive updates made to 
                      the system and shall receive Trader Support. It is the understanding 
                      of the customer the monthly fee will be reoccurring and 
                      is non-refundable for any reason.<br>
